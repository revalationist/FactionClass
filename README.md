ObjectOrientedFactions

This is a small project by me to make a factions system that uses JC MP classes effectively. While simple, the main advantage of this approach is that it allows users to expand the
system easily, because it comes with several methods and improves readibility.

For example, using events, you can do things like `args.faction:SetMorale(args.faction:GetMorale() + 10)`. The script currently comes with events when:

- A faction's morale or balance is changed
- A faction receives a new member
- A faction loses a member
- Anything you want, so long as you have a decent knowledge of scripting

I do not recommend using this system if you are inexperienced with Lua. Compared to some other scripts, it doesn't have many features and may not be as updated often.
